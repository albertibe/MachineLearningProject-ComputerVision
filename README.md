## Project Overview
The "Online Fraud Detection using Machine Learning" project aims to develop an intelligent system capable of identifying fraudulent transactions in online payment systems. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project enhances the security and reliability of online transactions, protecting users from potential financial losses and fraudulent activities.

## Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to build and train a robust machine learning model that can accurately detect fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones. The model will be designed to classify transactions in real-time, providing an added layer of security for online payment platforms.

## Data Sources
The dataset used in this project was provided by 10Alytics. The dataset contains a collection of features extracted from online transactions, including transaction amount, location, user behavior patterns, and other relevant information.
